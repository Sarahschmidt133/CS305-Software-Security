# CS305-Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  - Artemis Financial is a consulting company that works with individuals and businesses. They've asked us to address their web application to confirm the security is up to date, and that there are no potential attacks within their application. 


What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  - I feel like I did well in running the discrepancy checks on their web application to identify potential vulnerabilities. This is important because having secure and updated code is going to ensure there are fewer data breaches for Artemis Financial. If there was a data breach this could be detrimental to both the client and our business. 


What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
-	I liked running the dependency checks, this was a nice way to see what vulnerabilities you had instead of checking manually. I did struggle with the checksum part of the assessment, this is because it was somewhat difficult to ensure the website was secure, and how to make it secure with a security certificate. 


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
-	To increase the layers of security you really need to know the best practices of software security and coding quality. You also must have common knowledge of what types of software/web applications attackers may go after, like a financial company, medical places, or anything that basically has all your information. To decide on the number of layers of security you and your team will need to analyze what that website will need to be protected. 


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
-	I was cleaning/debugged the code and software application while working on the code. I then made sure that the refactored code was compiling and running the application correctly. I ran a dependency check beforehand and screenshot the vulnerabilities. After refactoring the code, I re-ran it to see if any new issues arose from my changes. 


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
-	The dependency check tool will help out in later assignments, and to help understand what needs to be fixed within the project.


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
-	I would be able to show them the past projects for Artemis financial to show that I can comprehend requirements, assess security vulnerabilities, and make the proper changes to the refactored code following the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram.
